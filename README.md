# Popy The Money Bot
A currency convertor chatbot.

## üê£ Introduction

We realized a Chabot with the Dialogflow api : https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/?fbclid=IwAR2wbsGeWMyDElEMIrw3EkXpv20C6RD-hHtYxdNCbI_hKBDK7_mMzH2tcpk#/editAgent/d8b32177-6082-46a6-aa02-3134c71e4f35/. PopyTheMoneyBot is able to convert an amount of money into various currencies (GBP, SEK, EUR, USD..) using the API : https://exchangeratesapi.io/.
Our chatbot was put on 3 servers : Facebook messenger https://www.facebook.com/Popy-The-Money-Bot-1225091967669661/ : , Skype (error server..) and Slack : . 

## üèÉ‚Äçüíª  How does it works ?

First, you can ask differents basics questions such as "Hi, how are you ?" or "Help me please". In order to convert an amount of money into currencies, you can ask simply "convert" to the Chatbot. It will answer you how to ask well the question with an example : "What is the amount and currency that you want to conver? e.g. 500 usd or 500 us dollars".
You can also ask : "How much is 100 euros ?", to convert an amount without specifying the currency, the Chatbot will ask you to complete.
